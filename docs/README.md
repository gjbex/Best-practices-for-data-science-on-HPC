There are many good reasons to run data science workloads on a High Performance
Computing (HPC) system. However, the transition from a laptop to an HPC system
can be daunting.  This training will help you make that transition.

You will also learn about potential pitfalls and how to avoid them.  This
training is not just about the good parts, but also about how to avoid the bad
parts.


## Learning outcomes

When you complete this training you will

  * be able to judge when to switch to an HPC environment;
  * be able to prepare your environment for R and Python;
  * be able to run a job on an HPC cluster that uses that environment;
  * be able to determine how long your computation will take;
  * be able to determine how much memory your computation will need;
  * be able to estimate the efficiency of your computation;
  * know the basics of how to run your computations efficiently;
  * know when it makes sense to use parallelization;
  * understand the basics and pitfalls of I/O on HPC systems;
  * are aware of potential pitfalls and how to avoid them.

## Training materials

All training materials are available in a 
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/hpcleuven/Best-practices-for-data-science-on-HPC).


## Target audience

This training is for you if you need to use R on HPC systems.


## Prerequisites

This is not a training that starts from scratch.  You have followed an HPC
introduction training session and you have a basic understanding of how to work
on the Bash command line.

You have experience with R or Python.
